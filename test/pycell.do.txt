======= Testing pycell =======

This is a cell that should execute automatically:

!bc pycod
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
print("The result is {}".format(c))
c
!ec

This is a cell that should plot and output:

!bc pycod
from pylab import *
x = linspace(0, 10, 100)
plot(x, x*x)
show()
!ec

!bc pycod-t
while True:
    i = 2
!ec
