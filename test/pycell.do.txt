======= Testing pycell =======

This is a cell that should execute automatically:

!bc pycod
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
print("The result is {}".format(c))
c
!ec

=== Plotting ===

This is a cell that should plot and output:

!bc pycod
from pylab import *
x = linspace(0, 10, 100)
plot(x, x*x)
show()
!ec

To improve quality when exporting to LaTeX, the following code has automatically
been run to enable PDF export in notebooks.

!bc pycod-t
from IPython.display import set_matplotlib_formats
set_matplotlib_formats('png', 'pdf')
!ec

=== Ignore output ===

Output from `pyout` and similar can be ignored by passing `--ignore_output` to
DocOnce:

!bc pycod
a = 2
print(a)
!ec

!bc pyout 
2
!ec

=== Not executed ===

This is a code block that should not be executed:

!bc pycod-t
while True:
    i = 2
!ec

This is some *formatted* stuff, which is _underlined_ and stuff and maybe even
contains $a + 2b$.
